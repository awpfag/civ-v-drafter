Civ V Drafter is a command line program for drafting random civilisations for players to pick from.

Up to 12 players can pick from up to 3 civilisations. Civilisations can also be banned so that they aren't randomly picked.

On GNU/Linux, you can automatically install by doing:

```git clone https://github.com/luckyy777/civ-v-drafter

cd civ-v-drafter/

sudo make install```
